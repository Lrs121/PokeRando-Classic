# PokeRando Classic
A work in progress Pokemon Randomizer based on the original [Dabomstew Universal Pokemon Randomizer.](https://github.com/Dabomstew/universal-pokemon-randomizer)
Why base it on the now archived UPR project? Because it is more simple and (hopefully) easier to port for a beginner programmer.
It combines a drive to create an Android app and my enjoyment of pokemon.

## Status
It Does NOTHING!
Development in progress

## Current Version
### skunkwerks1:
- Very, Very, Very basic UI
- Requests Storage Permissions
- Has some images

### skunkwerks2:
- open file
- save non-random file with new name
- verify file is rom
- Pokemon names array
- add select pokemon fragment (only lists pokemon names)
- full gen 1 support?(ambitious)

## FUTURE:
- Parity with Dabomstew UPR
